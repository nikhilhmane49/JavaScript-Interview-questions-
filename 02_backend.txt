//1Q)***************What is npm and npx************


****npm (Node Package Manager)

---->npm is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries
    and dependencies for their projects. It is an essential tool for Node.js development and is bundled with Node.js installations.

****npx (Node Package Execute)

--->npx is a tool that comes with npm (version 5.2.0 and above) and is designed to execute npm packages without needing to install them 
    globally or locally. It simplifies the execution of packages and one-time scripts.




//2Q*********************body-parser

we can use body-parser
The body-parser module enables us to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware.
Express.js server needs to know what type of data you're sending over the network, so it knows how to parse it.



//3Q*************************fetch

1___The fetch() method is a built-in JavaScript function used to make network requests, typically to retrieve data from a server


2___The fetch() method must take at least one argument, which is the URL (or path) of the resource you want to fetch (e.g., a JSON file, 
    API data, etc.). This could be an absolute or relative path to a resource hosted on a web server.


3____
1)__fetch() returns a Promise. A promise in JavaScript represents an operation that will either complete successfully in the future 
     (resolve) or fail (reject).
2)__When the fetch() method is called, it doesnâ€™t wait for the entire server response (including the data) to be ready. Instead, it 
    returns a Promise that resolves as soon as the server responds with headers.
3)___This means that the promise resolves to a Response object, even if the server returns an error (e.g., HTTP 404 or 500).


In short meaning of 3rd point---->


In simple terms, when you use the fetch() function to make a request to a server, it will always give you a response, even if something goes wrong (like the server not finding the page or having an internal error).

For example:

If the server can't find what you're asking for (like a 404 Not Found error), fetch() will still give you a response.
If there's a server problem (like a 500 Internal Server Error), fetch() still gives you a response.
However, this response doesn't automatically tell you if everything went well. You have to check the response to see if it was successful or if there was an error.

In short: fetch() doesn't "fail" right away if there's an error; it gives you a response, and it's your job to check if that response is good or not.




//4Q)***************************What is Axios?
Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making network requests to interact with APIs. It simplifies the process of sending requests to a server and handling responses. It is widely used in modern JavaScript applications (both in the browser and in Node.js) to perform operations like:

Fetching data from an API (e.g., GET requests).
Sending data to a server (e.g., POST requests).
Updating or deleting resources on a server (e.g., PUT and DELETE requests).
Handling response statuses and error handling more easily compared to the built-in fetch() method.

expmale:----->

const axios = require('axios');

// Making a GET request
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);  // Log the data received from the API
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);  // Handle errors
  });



//5Q)****************************What is React-Toastify?

     React-Toastify is a lightweight library that makes it easy to display notification messages (toasts) in a React 
     application. A toast is a popup notification that briefly appears on the screen and then disappears, commonly used for 
     success messages, errors, or warnings.
