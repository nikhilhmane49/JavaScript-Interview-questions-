//2Q*********************body-parser

we can use body-parser
The body-parser module enables us to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware.
Express.js server needs to know what type of data you're sending over the network, so it knows how to parse it.



//3Q**********************fetch

1___The fetch() method is a built-in JavaScript function used to make network requests, typically to retrieve data from a server


2___The fetch() method must take at least one argument, which is the URL (or path) of the resource you want to fetch (e.g., a JSON file, 
    API data, etc.). This could be an absolute or relative path to a resource hosted on a web server.


3____
1)__fetch() returns a Promise. A promise in JavaScript represents an operation that will either complete successfully in the future 
     (resolve) or fail (reject).
2)__When the fetch() method is called, it doesnâ€™t wait for the entire server response (including the data) to be ready. Instead, it 
    returns a Promise that resolves as soon as the server responds with headers.
3)___This means that the promise resolves to a Response object, even if the server returns an error (e.g., HTTP 404 or 500).
